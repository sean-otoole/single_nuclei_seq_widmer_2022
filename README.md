# single_nuclei_analysis_widmer_2022

AAnalysis of nuclei I collected from neocortical tissues infected with an AAV carrying Cre recombinase, which upon expression would knock out NMDA receptors. The overall aim of the study was to examine the molecular mechanisms underlying visuomotor coupling for the publication entitled: [NMDA receptors in visual cortex are necessary for normal visuomotor integration and skill learning](https://elifesciences.org/articles/71476).

At the moment this README is still under construction, more details to follow.
